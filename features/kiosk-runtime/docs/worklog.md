# KioskRuntime — worklog

Evidence, by task ID. A checkmark with no command output is not evidence.

Append entries; do not rewrite history. If a gate failed and was then fixed,
both belong here — a task that failed twice is a signal worth keeping.

## Template

Record the scaffold before anything else: the command the Lead actually ran and
what it put on disk. That is what makes the chain checkable —
`plan command → command run → filesystem → task evidence`. Without it, nobody
can tell later whether a file was generated, hand-written, or left over.

The entry evidence depends on the task's declared mode, so record the mode
first. `behavior`, `bug` and `behavior-change` open with RED; `refactor` opens
with a named BASELINE shown green; `config` has no RED at all — run the thing
it configures and paste the result under VERIFICATION.

```
### T01 — <objective>
MODE: behavior | bug | behavior-change | refactor | config
ACCEPTANCE: AC-xx | Supporting AC-xx | N/A — <reason>

SCAFFOLD          (Lead, before delegating — omit only when genuinely N/A)
  $ <the exact generator command the Lead ran>
  created  : <paths>
  skipped  : <paths that already existed>
  replaced : <paths overwritten, and why that was safe>
  manual   : <planned artifacts no capability covers>

RED               (behavior | bug | behavior-change)
  $ <command>
  <the failure, and why it is the RIGHT failure — not a typo or bad import>

BASELINE          (refactor)
  $ <command naming the existing tests being preserved>
  <green, before any change>

IMPLEMENT
  <the smallest change that does it>

GREEN             (behavior | bug | behavior-change | refactor)
  $ <command>
  <pass>

VERIFICATION      (config)
  $ <the thing it configures, actually run>
  <output proving the configuration works — not that a file contains a string>

AFFECTED CHECKS
  $ <typecheck / lint / focused tests>
  <result>

DIFF
  <files touched, and anything surprising>

GATE: PASS | FAIL
```

Delete the lines that do not apply to the mode. An empty RED heading under a
`config` task is the fabricated evidence this shape exists to prevent.

### RESEARCH — five read-only evidence packets (2026-09-02)

Launched as fresh generic Super Z research contexts (no repository custom
research agent matches internet/platform scopes; the Flutter/Supabase/UI
researchers are explicitly N/A for this feature). Full packets were returned
in-session; the durable record is the synthesis in `docs/plan.md` with
per-finding primary-source URLs. Agent resume ids (Super Z coordination log):
R-A `agent-87081c68…`, R-B `agent-f1269dfd…`, R-C `agent-3967d83b…`,
R-D `agent-90263207…`, R-E `agent-10ed1c6b…`.

R-A Android Enterprise / Dedicated Devices / managed configurations /
lock-task — 22 findings, HIGH confidence. Key: DPC owns kiosk enforcement;
`android:lockTaskMode="if_whitelisted"` dual-role mechanism;
`android.content.APP_RESTRICTIONS` meta-data; restrictions read once and
cached; `ACTION_APPLICATION_RESTRICTIONS_CHANGED` → dynamically registered
receiver only (no listener API in the SDK — verified against live
reference); `KEY_RESTRICTIONS_PENDING`; defaults never appear in the
bundle; `isLockTaskPermitted` + `getLockTaskModeState()` (LOCKED ≠ PINNED)
as read-only corroboration.

cookbook), /work/managed-configurations, RestrictionsManager/DevicePolicyManager/
ActivityManager/KeyguardManager references (2025-02 → 2026-08 footers).
R-B Expo SDK 54 / RN 0.81 / local modules / plugins / CNG / signing —
19 findings, HIGH. Key: `./modules` autolink; expo-module.config.json
shape; `requireOptionalNativeModule` (SDK 54 — no
`OptionalRequireNativeModule`); AsyncFunction/Events/OnStartObserving DSL;
`withAndroidManifest` + `addMetaDataItemToMainApplication(..., 'resource')` + `withDangerousMod` for res/xml; CNG regenerates android/ (template signs
release with debug keystore — e2e workflow depends on it); MYAPP*UPLOAD*_
guarded signing block; `android.versionCode` via app config (SDK 54);
apksigner/aapt2 verification. Verified against installed node_modules.

versions/v54.0.0/_), reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android,
expo-template-bare-minimum sdk-54.
R-C ManageEngine MDM Cloud product — 9 findings, HIGH. Key: QR-template →
Fully Managed; Single-App Kiosk needs Device Owner; in-house APK silent
install on DO without Play; managed app configurations supported for
in-house apps when the app declares the schema; updates silent on DO,
versionCode must increase, no downgrade; kiosk relaunch after reboot may
clear login sessions; recovery = pause kiosk / recovery key; Free edition
(25 devices) includes kiosk + AE + Enterprise Apps + REST APIs.
Sources: manageengine.com/mobile-device-management/help/\*\* (last updated
2026-07/08), edition-comparison-matrix.html (2025-04-03).
R-D ManageEngine REST API / Zoho OAuth — 10 findings, HIGH. Key: scopes
`MDMOnDemand.MDMDeviceMgmt.ALL` + `MDMInventory.READ` (no
`MDMCloud.MDMAPI`); base `https://mdm.manageengine.com/api/v1/mdm/_`     (9 data centres);`Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken <token>`; two-phase
     `/emsapi/files`(Module: MDM_APP_MGMT, multipart key`file`) → fileID →
     poll status; `POST /api/v1/mdm/apps`app_type 2; labels/channels;
    `POST /api/v1/mdm/groups/{id}/apps`silent_install; device app status;
     approve/distribute_update (production — NOT automated); ~60/min rate
     limit + 5-min lock; error envelope; Zoho exposed-credentials policy
     counts logs as exposure → mask.
     Sources: manageengine.com/mobile-device-management/api/** + help/api/cloud/**,
     zoho.com/developer/oauth/** (2026).
  R-E GitHub Actions release safety — 17 findings, HIGH. Key: same-repo PRs DO
     receive secrets → gate by trigger; unset secret → "" (fail-closed env
     check primitive); environment secrets + required reviewers (public repo on
     Free — this repository is public, verified by anonymous clone); implicit
     environment creation hazard; workflow_dispatch runs only from default
     branch; concurrency groups; upload-artifact v7`if-no-files-found: error`;
permissions contents: read; persist-credentials: false; pull_request never
pull_request_target. Sources: docs.github.com/\*\* + actions READMEs
(fetched 2026-09-02).

### BASELINE — pre-implementation evidence (2026-09-02)

$ git clone https://github.com/mohammed7779948484-tech/Kisok_react_app.git
→ public repo (anonymous clone works); branch feature/kiosk-runtime
created from origin/main 80b8ac3cc6cc4a569e165c2bc5bdb72ddc9df618;
origin/develop = 80b8ac3 (equals main at session start).
$ pnpm install --frozen-lockfile → OK (pnpm 9.12.0 via corepack shim).
$ pnpm generate feature kiosk-runtime --role=shared
created : features/kiosk-runtime/index.ts, docs/{brief,plan,todo,worklog,review}.md
$ pnpm verify → PASS (generator smoke test last line:
"KISOK generator smoke test passed"); working tree afterwards:
only `?? features/kiosk-runtime/`.
Probe: jest cannot import `.mjs` tool modules (babel-jest leaves ESM
untransformed — scratch probe failed as expected) → tool scripts are
TypeScript, colocated `.test.ts`, executed by Node 24 native
type-stripping (`node <file>.ts` probe PASS on v24.19.0).
External dependency recorded: `git push --dry-run` fails — no GitHub
credentials in this environment. Branch push / Draft PR / GitHub CI /
live MDM dry-run are human/external actions (see plan Verification and
brief Evidence).
